## Technologies
- `Telegram Bot API`: The Telegram Bot API is utilized to integrate Telegram bot functionalities into the project. This enables efficient communication and interaction with users on the Telegram platform.
- `OpenAI API`: We integrate the OpenAI API to generate personalized cover letters for the last chosen vacancy by the user.
- `opencsv:` The opencsv library is employed to efficiently read files containing vacancy information.
- `lombok`: Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code in the project. With its annotations, Lombok simplifies the codebase, making it more concise and readable while maintaining the necessary functionality.
- `Spring Boot`: The project is built on the Spring Boot framework, which offers a robust and streamlined development experience. Spring Boot's features, including dependency management and auto-configuration, contribute to the creation of scalable and maintainable applications.
